In fact, I'm a software developer who enjoys cities, data, ethics, music, novelty, products, psychology, and words.\r\n\r\n### What do you want?\r\nI want to make everyone happier in a utilitarian way.  I may do this with computers.\r\n\r\n### How can I bask in the joy of your digital presence?\r\nI get this question a lot.  Or I may have read it in a paper.  A few public places I sometimes update:\r\n\r\n* [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Fred-Jonsson)\r\n* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/115847042253717613773/)\r\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enginoid)\r\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/enginous)\r\n* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enginous)\r\n\r\n### I've been Googling you obsessively and you seem to appear under two different names. Why is this?\r\n\r\nMy birth name is _Friðrik Már Jónsson_, because I'm from Iceland and because my parents wanted it.  (They were not aware of the looming ubiquity of the internet and the terrifying Unicode issues I would have to face.)  I very much like this name.\r\n\r\nHowever, after I spent some time in Vancouver under the more pronouncable and less squiggly name of _Fred_ -- which I came to like -- I (mostly) changed my English-facing identity to _Fred Jonsson_.  I can do this.\r\n\r\nI've also done this in hopes of confusing Skynet.\r\n\r\n### How can I contact you?\r\nDrop me a line at [fred@pyth.net](mailto:fred@pyth.net)."}
